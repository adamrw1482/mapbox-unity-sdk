## Landmarks Module

The Landmarks Module adds detailed 3D landmark buildings to your map. These are high-quality, architect-modeled buildings with PBR materials — significantly more detailed than the basic extruded buildings produced by the Vector or Components modules.

When landmarks are enabled, the SDK automatically hides any basic OSM buildings that overlap with a landmark, so you don't get double geometry.

### Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is to import the demo scene. Open the **Package Manager** window (`Window → Package Manager`), find the **Mapbox Unity SDK** package, and go to the **Samples** tab. Click **Import** next to the Landmark Demo — this gives you a fully configured scene you can open and play immediately.

To add landmarks to your own scene, follow the steps below.

### Setting Up Landmarks

**Prerequisites:** A working map with `MapboxMapBehaviour` and at least one building module (Components Module or Vector Module). Zoom level must be 14 or higher.

#### Step 1: Add the Landmarks Module

1. Select your map GameObject (the one with `MapboxMapBehaviour`)
2. Add the `LandmarksLayerModuleScript` component
3. Assign a **Base Material** — this is the PBR material used for all landmark models. Use `LandmarkMaterialGLTF.mat` from the demo as a starting point

That's it — landmarks will now appear on the map. But you'll likely see basic OSM buildings overlapping with the landmarks. The next steps fix that.

#### Step 2: Suppress Overlapping Buildings

You need one connector for each building module you're using. Most projects use either the Components Module or the Vector Module for buildings, not both — so you typically only need one connector.

**If you're using the Components Module for buildings:**

1. Add `LandmarkToBuildingComponentConnector` to your map GameObject
2. Assign:
   - **Map** → your `MapBehaviourCore`
   - **LandmarksLayerModuleScript** → the landmarks module you added in Step 1
   - **BuildingLayerVisualizerObject** → the `BuildingComponentVisualizerObject` asset your Components Module uses

**If you're using the Vector Module for buildings:**

1. Create a filter asset: right-click in Project → `Create → Mapbox → Filters → Landmark Polygon Filter`
2. Open your vector building layer's filter stack asset and add the new filter to its **Filters** list
3. Add `LandmarkToVectorConnector` to your map GameObject
4. Assign:
   - **Map** → your `MapBehaviourCore`
   - **LandmarksLayerModuleScript** → the landmarks module you added in Step 1
   - **VectorModuleScript** → your vector module
   - **LandmarkFilter** → the filter asset you created in step 1

#### Step 3: Play

Enter Play Mode. Landmark buildings appear as detailed 3D models. Basic OSM buildings at the same locations are automatically suppressed.

### How the Overlap Suppression Works

The two connectors use different strategies based on how each building module works:

- **Components connector** — The Components Module bakes all buildings into a single merged mesh per tile, so individual buildings can't be skipped during generation. Instead, the connector detects overlapping buildings after they're generated and hides them by zeroing their vertices.

- **Vector connector** — The Vector Module processes buildings one at a time through a filter stack before generating meshes. The connector injects landmark footprint polygons into this filter stack, so overlapping buildings are simply never created. This is more efficient since no geometry is wasted.

Both connectors handle the case where landmarks and buildings load in either order. If buildings load first, they're checked (or reprocessed) when landmarks arrive. If landmarks load first, the data is ready when buildings are processed.

### Troubleshooting

**Landmarks don't appear:**
- Confirm `LandmarksLayerModuleScript` is on the same GameObject as `MapboxMapBehaviour`
- Check that **Base Material** is assigned
- Make sure the map zoom level is 14 or higher
- Check the Console for errors

**Basic buildings still showing under landmarks:**
- Make sure you added the correct connector for your building module
- For the Vector connector: confirm the `LandmarkPolygonFilterObject` asset is in the vector building layer's filter stack
- For the Components connector: confirm the `BuildingComponentVisualizerObject` is assigned
